# Exercise 4, Week 5
In this exercise we use backpropagating in order to calculate (learn) the weights for a particular Neural Network. 
Initially the weights are given in ex4weights.mat, in order to calculate the cost function and its gradient for 
these given weights. Then we use the fmincg optimization routine to find the optimal weights. 
The most important files are the nnCostFunction.m, and the driver: ex4driver.docx. Enjoy!
