# ML-Course
These are my (private) solutions for the Machine Learning Course offered on . 

There are 8 programming exercises / projects in this course. 
I upload my solutions to each exercise separately together with a driver for each exercise. 
The driver is important as it walks through the solution of the exercise and it describes the exact requirements, the given data and the goals.
