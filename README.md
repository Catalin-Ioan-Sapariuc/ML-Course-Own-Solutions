# ML-Coursera-Course-Own-Solutions 
In Exercise 1 you will find the solutions in Matlab of a linear regression problem (2 - D and N - D). 
The main functions are the computeCost.m , computeCostMulti.m and gradientDescent.m, gradientDescentMulti.m . 
The files driver-from-orig.docx and driver-companion.docx describe the problem in detail and how it is solved 
using these functions.
