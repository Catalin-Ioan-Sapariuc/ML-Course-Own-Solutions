# ML-Course
These are my (private) solutions for the Machine Learning Course offered on Coursera and at Stanford and taught by Prof. Ng . 

In this week's exercise, we consider a small non-linear data set, and we study ways to improve the initial linear regression, first by applying a polynomial
regression of degree 8 (although the implementation allows any degree), normalizing the new features, and then following a bias- variance study in order to find the best regularization parameter lambda which minimizes the cross-validation error.
